# GitHub Repository Setup Commands

To complete the GitHub deployment setup, run these commands:

## 1. Create GitHub Repository

Visit https://github.com/new and create a repository named `ContactPlus` (or your preferred name).

## 2. Configure Git Remote

```bash
# Replace YOUR_USERNAME with your GitHub username
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/ContactPlus.git

# Or if you prefer SSH:
# git remote add origin git@github.com:YOUR_USERNAME/ContactPlus.git
```

## 3. Push to GitHub

```bash
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```

## 4. Set up Self-Hosted Runner

```bash
# Run the setup script
./scripts/setup_mac_runner.sh
```

Then follow the GitHub instructions to configure the runner:
1. Go to your repository Settings ‚Üí Actions ‚Üí Runners
2. Click "New self-hosted runner"
3. Select "macOS"
4. Follow the configuration steps

## 5. Update Repository URL in Scripts

Edit these files to replace `YOUR_USERNAME` with your actual GitHub username:
- `scripts/setup_mac_runner.sh` (line 14)
- `GITHUB_DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md` (line 24)

## 6. Test Deployment

Once the runner is configured, push any change to trigger automatic deployment:

```bash
echo "# Test deployment" >> README.md
git add README.md
git commit -m "Test automatic deployment"
git push origin main
```
